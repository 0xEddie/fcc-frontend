			Denied tenureship at Harvard unexpectedly, in part due to recommendations by former colleagues who didn't like his
			publicized science advocacy work (perceived as self promotion on the backs of other's work). He then moved to work
			at the Cornell astronomy department for the rest of his life.
			1972
			Assembled the first physical message sent into space: a plaque attached to space probe Pioneer 10
			1977

			audience of viewers, whom Sagan felt had lost interest in science, partly due to a stifled educational system.
			1985
			Wrote "Contact", a hard science fiction novel about the first contact between humans and extra-terrestrials.
			1996
			Passed away at 62 years of age, from pneumonia after enduring myelodysplastia for 2 years.
