- It's cool seeing fcc finally start sprinkling in utility style classes
- how hard is it to contribute to these exercise pages? The white spacing is inconsistent between levels in the "insert your code here" blurbs
- `text-indent` is a new property I haven't seen before
- interesting how much negative pixel values are used for `margin`. Not super sure how much I love that.
