			<header> What is Static Analysis</header>
			<p>
				It is tooling that scrutinizes code without running it, as opposed to "dynamic analysis" which tests the result
				of running code - like testing (unit tests or large end-to-end tests).
			</p>
			<p>
				Static analysis also has a spectrum, but from âš¡ Speed <code><==></code> Power ðŸ’ª

				<li>Linters</li>
				<li>Type Checkers</li>
			</ol>

		<section class="main-section" id="What_is_Formatting">
			<header> What is Formatting</header>
			<p>
				A formatter is a tool that
			<ol>
				<li>reads your source code</li>
				<li>ignores your formatting</li>
				<li>rewrites it based on config rules</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				Ex. Prettier
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="What_is_a_Linter">
			<header>What is a Linter</header>
			<p>
				A linter is a tool that runs a set of checks on your source code
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Each check is a rule</li>
				<li>Each rule may report on code it doesn't like</li>
				<li>Each complaint may contain an optional autofix</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				ESLint is a tool built into most text editors for identifying and reporting on patterns found in
				ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Every single rule of ESLint is a plugin</li>
				<li>More rules can be added at runtime</li>
				<li>The functionality of ESLint can be extended further by using community plugins, configs and parsers</li>
			</ul>

			<header>Running ESLint</header>
			<p>
				To install ESLint in a Node.js app, enter in your terminal:
			</p>
			<pre><code>
				npm install eslint --save-dev
				npm init @eslint/config # eslint config wizard

				npx eslint . # lint everything, in this directory
			</code></pre>
			<p>
				<b>Note:</b> <code>npm init @eslint/config</code> assumes you have a <code>package.json</code> file already.
				If you donâ€™t, make sure to run <code>npm init</code> or <code>yarn init</code> beforehand.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="Configuring_ESLint">
			<header>Configuring ESLint</header>
			<p>
				ESLint rules can be configured in <code>.eslintrc.js</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
			</p>
			<pre><code>
				// .eslintrc.js
				module.exports = {
					// what eslint team thinks most codebases probably want
					"extends": [
						"eslint:recommended",
						// config for React
						"plugin:react/recommended",
						"plugin:react-hooks/recommended"
					],
					"parserOptions": {
						"ecmaFeatures": {
							"jsx": true
						}
					},
					"plugins": ["react", "react-hooks"],
					"settings": {

			<p>
				When disabling eslint for a single line like
			</p>
			<pre><code>
				// eslint-disable-next-line no-console
				console.log("ðŸ¥º")
			</code></pre>
			<p>
				but then the <code>console.log</code> is later removed but <code>// eslint-disable</code> is not,
				this will raise an exception so that you can find and remove it.
			</p>
			<pre><code>
				// package.json
				{
					"scripts": {
						"lint": "eslint . --report-unused-disable-directives"
					}
				}
			</code></pre>

			<p>
				<code>lint:fix</code> will fix whatever stuff has an autofix available
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>--max-warnings 0</code> silences warnings from eslint, which is good to train us to not become complacent
				about eslint messages.
			</p>
			<pre><code>
				// package.json
				{
					"scripts": {
						"lint": "eslint . --report-unused-disable-directives",
						"lint:fix": "npm run lint -- --fix"
